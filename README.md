# Star Wars Cards
 React app that gets data from [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) and renders a list of the characters in the Star Wars Universe, if you click on a name more data appears regarding that specific character.

 The app was started with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) and I added [react-transition-group](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transition-group) for the animations. 

##### This is a training App I'm making to practice new concepts so it's constantly being improved.
